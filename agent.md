This is the documentation of my learning journey about agents in AI.

I found the way to develop and learn the agent by starting simple, then gradually increasing the complexity.

Step 1: Simple CLI-based AI chat that answers, nothing more.
Step 2: Adding tool/s, probably Weather, Calculator, News, Arxiv, Wikipidea, etc.
Step 3: Adding the RAG for pdfs using Vector store.
Step 4: Adding multiple agents, proly a Research Agent
Step 5: Adding MCP server.
